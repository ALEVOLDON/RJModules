# RJModules

Various DIY modules for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).

None of them actually exist yet, but I'm hoping this will eventually contain:

  * FFTTuner - FFT / Tuner
  * VCMono - Combine two signals into one, modulated by VC
  * VCSplitter - Split one signal into two, modulated by VC 
  * VCBitCrush - Bit Crusher 
  * BPM - Dial in a pulse to a specific beats per minute. Also VC-able and "reset"-able.
  * Sidechain - Lower the volume of A based on B.
  * Autopanner - Given a signal, oscillate into two output channels 
  * VCDryWet
  * Button - It's literally just a fucking button. You hit it, it sends a reset signal. 
  * DubEcho - Two delays and a spring.
